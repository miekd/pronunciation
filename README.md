# Pronunciation

A simple web project that allows you to explain people how to pronounce a certain word. Especially great for names with weird spelling or silly usernames.

## Examples

1. http://pronunciation.miekd.com/
2. http://pronunciation.maykelloomans.com/

## How does it work?

Obviously it's super basic: the `_data.php` file has an array of data in it, which you can edit.
